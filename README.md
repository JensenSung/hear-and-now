hear-now
========

hear&amp;now is a lightweight interactive audio mixer library for cool dudes

caveat emptor
=============

hear&amp;now is in early development, and should not be considered thread-safe, work-safe, or dishwasher-safe.  it is being developed by a couple of dudes who haven't really developed a ton of audio software before.  the terms of the license for hear&amp;now explicitly preclude you from using it to throw a rave at a nuclear power plant or hospital.
